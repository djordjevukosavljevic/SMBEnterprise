    <div class="text-center" style="font-size: 20px;">
        Founded in 2008 in Paris, our company was built on a simple vision: to create spaces that combine strength,
        beauty, and functionality. Over the years, we have grown from a small local team into a trusted construction
        partner, recognized for our ability to deliver projects of every scale—from private homes and apartment
        buildings to medical centers, restaurants, and bars.

    <div class="text-center" style="font-size: 20px;">
        Our work spans new builds, renovations, and complete transformations. Whether it’s designing a modern family
        home, restoring a historic building, or adapting a space to meet the strict standards of a healthcare facility,
        we bring the same level of care and precision to every project. Our team of engineers, architects, and craftsmen
        work closely with clients, ensuring that each idea is carefully developed into a lasting reality.</b>
    </div><br><br>
    <div class="text-center" style="font-size: 20px;">
        We pride ourselves on our Parisian roots and our dedication to quality. Every project reflects our commitment to
        innovation, sustainability, and timeless design, while respecting budgets and deadlines. From the first sketch
        to the final detail, we focus on creating spaces that are not only functional but also inspiring for the people
        who live, work, and gather in them.

        With more than 15 years of experience, we continue to build on a foundation of trust, transparency, and
        craftsmanship, shaping the future of construction in Paris and beyond.
